# Christine Zivic – GitHub Portfolio

## Welcome to My Portfolio
Hi, I'm **Christine Zivic**, a Python developer specializing in **workflow automation, media processing, and metadata management**. This GitHub serves as a collection of **projects that demonstrate my coding skills, problem-solving approach, and software development expertise**.

## 🔹 About Me
🎥 Background in VFX & Post-Production Automation – I build tools that streamline media asset management, metadata extraction, and file organization.

🛠 Strong Python Development Skills – Experienced in CLI tools, APIs, automation scripts, and structured data processing.

🗂 Expertise in Data & Metadata Processing – I work with structured filenames, databases, and file integrity validation.

🚀 Building Efficient Pipelines – My code helps move and track assets in high-volume production environments.

📡 Advanced File Synchronization – Developed automation scripts that function as a highly personalized rsync, ensuring efficient and structured media transfers.

📝 Editorial Tracking – Wrote tools that parse EDLs and OpenTimelineIO (OTIO) to track and manage editorial timeline changes.

🎞 Video Processing Automation – Created scripts to automate resolution and codec conversions, ensuring compatibility across media workflows.

🔗 Seamless Integration with Industry Tools – My code integrates with Nuke, DaVinci Resolve, AVID, and other media software for automated asset and workflow management.
